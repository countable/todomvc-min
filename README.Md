# TODOMVC.min

This is my attempt to write a _generic_ library to implement the TodoMvc app as simply as possible.

Of course, I didn't "cheat" by making the library too specific to the problem of writing a TODO list. At least not much.

I feel the resulting code is nearly as terse as a definition in any language could reasonably be.

# Testing
